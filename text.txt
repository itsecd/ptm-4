Every educated person on planet Earth knows that Russia is the largest country in the world. Its vast expanses occupy one-tenth of the overall land of our planet.
Its landscape is mesmerizing. Tall mountains, boundless oceans and seas, pure water rivers and streams, giant marshes and steppes, huge forests and frozen glaciers. Nearly all types of natural habitats can be found on its vast territory. More than hundred thousand water reservoirs are located there. Baikal is especially popular among tourists and foreign visitors. Its deep blue surface can be seen on many postcards and national souvenirs.
The Russian culture is as vast and intricate as its abundant landscape. People living in this country are known for their open-mindedness and sincere hospitality. They enjoy spending all types of holidays with broad celebrations. Visiting Russia, one can be sure there will be plenty of delicious meals to try and new hobbies to acquire. For example, all foreign tourists are offered to visit “Russian banya”, which is very similar to the Finnish sauna, but implies jumping into the frozen ice-hole after the main steaming procedure, instead of the civilized swimming-pool. It may seem like a barbaric tradition, but in reality it’s a very healthy and useful habit.
Speaking of Russian history, it is most accurate to mention Peter the Great’s policy and reforms. He was the most powerful ruler of the country, who significantly widened the territory and turned Russia into a grand empire. After his governing, which lasted almost forty years the country flourished.
